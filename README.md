## ርእሲ Meaning

ርእሲ, pronounced r-uh-si, literally means "head" in the Tigrinya language and comes from the proto-semitic [raʔš-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Semitic/ra%CA%94š-).

It was also used as a title for the old Abyssinian nobility, equivalent to [duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_aristocratic_and_court_titles#Ras), e.g. as in _Ras_ [Tefari Mekonnen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Selassie) (origin of [Rastafarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari)).

The reference is two-fold: the set of cryptographic problems related to playing fair games over a distance is commonly named [_Mental_ Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker). And while the techniques used to do mental poker are not limited to poker, or indeed card games, the most powerful cards in games utilizing the French-suited 52-card deck are typically the royal ones.
